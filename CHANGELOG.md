# Changelog

One section per `bridge/VERSION`. Apps update with `dotnet build -t:UpdateBridge`; entries marked **ABI** change the C ABI (`bridge/host/omasharp.h` ⟷ `bridge/cs/Native.cs`), so an app that customized either file must merge both before it runs again.

## 0.0.1-rc.1

First public version: the bridge (window apps over the C ABI, panels over JSON lines), the `omarchy-app` template with the `omasharp` agent skill (`check.sh`: unit tests, then the app run in a private compositor, with its visible text and a screenshot), `UpdateBridge`, `Drawing`/`DrawView`, `Theme`, and async methods as Promises. Apps build with warnings as errors, .NET's recommended analyzers and the native AOT ones on every build, and omasharp's own analyzers (the `Omasharp.Analyzers` package, OMASHARP001–010) checking the backend against what QML can do. The bridge calls `Dispose()` on an `IDisposable` backend when the app exits.
